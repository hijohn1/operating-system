Write a program the implements the 3 disk-scheduling algorithms that you did NOT implement for HW#4: 

FCFS 

SSTF 

SCAN 

C-SCAN 

LOOK 

C-LOOK 

 

Your program will service a disk drive with 5,000 cylinders numbered 0-4,999.  

The program will use the set of 50 track requests provided below and service them according to the three algorithms you did not implement in HW#4. The program will be passed the initial position of the disk head and the direction in which it should be moving as parameters on the command line and shall report the total amount of head movement by each algorithm.
