Write a multithreaded program that tests your solution to HW#1. You will create several threads – for example, 100 – and each thread will request a pid, sleep for a random period of time, and then release the pid. (Sleeping for a random period approximates the typical pid usage in which a pid is assigned to a new process, the process executes and terminates, and the pid is released on the process’ termination).  

On UNIX and Linux systems, sleeping is accomplished through the sleep() function, which is passed an integer value representing the number of seconds to sleep.
