pid manager. The pid is returned to the pid manager when the process completes execution, and the manager may later reassign this pid. Process identifiers
must be unique; no two active processes may have the same pid.
  
  Use the following constants to identify the range of possible pid values:
  
   #define MIN_PID 300
   
   #define MAX_PID 5000
  
  You may use any data structure of your choice to represent the availability of process identifiers. One strategy is to adopt what Linux has done and use 
a bitmap in which a value of 0 at position i indicates that a process id of value i is available and a value of 1 indicates that the process id is currently 
in use.
   
  
  Implement the following API for obtaining and releasing a pid:
     
   • int allocate_map(void) – Creates and initializes a data structure for representing pids; returns -1 if unsuccessful and 1 if successful
   
   • int allocate_pid(void) – Allocates and returns a pid; returns -1 if if unable to allocate a pid (all pids are in use)
   
   • void release_pid(int_pid) – Releases a pid.
